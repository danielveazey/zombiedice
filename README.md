# zombiedice

A Python version of the Steve Jackson game "Zombie Dice." You can choose to keep rolling or bank your brains.

I just wanted to make it so the dice and the players were both objects in Python.

## Stuff I want to change

I want to make it more of a module than a full game. Instead of having all the print functions, I just want to return results when functions are called from whatever interface. Then I want to do some machine learning to play thousands of games and learn the best strategy.
